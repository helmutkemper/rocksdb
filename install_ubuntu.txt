DEBUG_LEVEL=0 make shared_lib install-shared
In this way, the installation is already generated in the production mode.

If you want to save time, you can specify the quantities of processors used in the process by passing -j[n], in my case, -j4

DEBUG_LEVEL=0 make -j4 shared_lib install-shared
In the case of ubuntu, this is sufficient, but in the case of ubuntu for docker, you should specify where the lib was installed.

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

sudo ldconfig -v
Update caches of shared libraries
